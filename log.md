# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Read the blog post, did some reading on Android Studio, came up with some project ideas.

**Thoughts**: Very nervous to commit to 100 days of code.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Installed Android Studio, imported my Android app "KitchenMaster" project, troubleshot import problems, learned basics of adding search feature to Android apps.

**Thoughts**: Why is it that instead of CODING you spend most of the time COPING with software installs?! Moving from Eclipse to Android Studio is totally killing me....

### Day 2: January 4, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Had to reorganize the app code for Android Studio and re-write some pieces. Got it to work on an emulator, but it's so outdated the action bar (menu) stopped working (even though on my 4.4 Android phone the app works fine, must be the support libraries...). Learned about ActionBar and ToolBar, which one to use and how.  

**Thoughts**: I wish Android libraries were more backwards compatible out of the box without messing with support libraries.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Had to pause working on my KitchenMaster app in favor of learning how to convert a ListActivity into an AppCompatActivity. I managed that by using a test project, which I called "White Wine List". Had to read a ton and troubleshoot a kilo.

**Thoughts**: I learned a lot about how Views work in Android apps, troubleshooting is the best teacher.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: On my beautiful "White Wine List" App, I added a ToolBar and a SearchView, to enable searching for wine types. Spent more than an hour due to research and troubleshooting.

**Thoughts**: Android guides don't make it easy to learn, it appears. StackOverflow rules in that respect.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: On my beautiful "White Wine List" App, on my ToolBar there's now a functional Search button and a "Add New" button, which I'll have to implement. I made search work, but still haven't been able to make the results of the search show up. I also implemented a database backend based on a text file that gets loaded into a virtual SQL table. I learned about Content Providers a bit, which I didn't intend to, but had to in order to implement db and search...

**Thoughts**: It's getting a little frustrating: every time I sit down for an hour of code, I end up spending way more than that just to make a real accomplishment for the day, but Java is not cooperating.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: On my beautiful "White Wine List" App, search widget now works and returns results, athough they lack style, so look ugly. Piled through tutorials on how to implement returning results from search

**Thoughts**: I wish at least one of the tutorials I found was complete and bug-free.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: On my beautiful "White Wine List" App, played around with style and layouts. Watched coursera videos about Intents for Android.

**Thoughts**: Today was a little bit more relaxing.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: On my beautiful "White Wine List" App, I figured out how to display multiple columns with a custom adapter class. Implemented that and made some slight style changes to improve viewing.

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty confident with displaying results in views.
