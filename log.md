**Today's Progress**: Installed Android Studio, imported my Android app "KitchenMaster" project, troubleshot import problems, learned basics of adding search feature to Android apps.

**Thoughts**: Why is it that instead of CODING you spend most of the time COPING with software installs?! Moving from Eclipse to Android Studio is totally killing me....
